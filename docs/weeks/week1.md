# Week 1


To start I downloaded the component [Object Detector](https://github.com/JdeRobot/dl-objectdetector). In this component, you can upload the model of your neural network and the captured image of a webcam or video to test how your neural network works. In mi case I used a ssdlite_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_05_29.pb model and a traffic video. In the next image you can see an example:
